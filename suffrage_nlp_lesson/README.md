# Analyzing Women's Suffrage vs. Anti-Suffrage Texts with TF-IDF

## Lesson Summary
In this lesson, you will learn how to use basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools to compare women's suffrage and anti-suffrage writings using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency). We will explore how certain words and concepts dominated each discourse by calculating the relative importance of words in a set of historical texts.

This short Programming Historianâ€“style tutorial is designed to be beginner-friendly and uses Python with `scikit-learn` and `pandas`. All you need is a basic understanding of Python and access to a Jupyter Notebook.
